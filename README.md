# dotnet-template-templates

Templates for "dotnet new" for creating project and item templates.

# Installing

To install the templates, run:

```
dotnet new -i FiftyProtons.Templates.DotNetNew
```

# Run from source

To install the templates directly from the repository, run the following command from the root of this repository:

```
dotnet new -i src/Templates/content
```

These are a work-in-progress, and corresponding NuGet packages will be published shortly.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have questions or would like to help out :-)
